# Project Uber
This repository contains the culmination of my early career journey in Python programming, focusing on data analysis. Named "Project Uber," it signifies a significant milestone where I delved into the world of Python and utilized its capabilities to analyze Uber data spanning from 2014 to 2015. Throughout this project, I extensively utilized various libraries and tools including Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium, and operating system utilities.

# Project Overview
Project Uber is not just about analyzing data; it's a testament to the comprehensive data analytics lifecycle I employed to derive insights and conclusions. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

## 1. Understanding the Use Case
Before delving into the data, it was imperative to grasp the use case thoroughly. This step involved collaborating closely with stakeholders, often business analysts or domain experts, to comprehend the project's requirements. Understanding the business landscape, existing data sources, and project goals laid the foundation for subsequent analysis.

## 2. Running the ETL Pipeline
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline forms the backbone of any data analytics endeavor. In this phase, raw data was transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis. While traditionally handled by data engineers, in this project, I executed the ETL pipeline, encompassing the following sub-steps:

Extract Data: Raw data, sourced from various formats including CSV, TSV, or JSON, was gathered. This raw data often required cleaning due to issues like typos, errors, or missing values.

Transform Data: The extracted data underwent transformation to ensure it met the prerequisites for analysis. Tasks such as deduplication, error correction, and filling missing values were performed to obtain featurized data, ready for analysis.

Load Data: Once transformed, the prepared data was loaded or exported, typically to CSV files or big data platforms, depending on the scale of the project.

## 3. EDA and Conclusion
With featurized data in hand, the focus shifted to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Through various visualization techniques including line graphs, bar graphs, heatmaps, and pivot tables, the data was explored comprehensively. Key questions regarding sales trends, product performance, and temporal patterns were addressed, leading to actionable insights.

# Tools and Techniques Utilized
Throughout Project Uber, an array of tools and techniques were employed:

## Programming Language: 
Python served as the primary language for data manipulation and analysis.
## Libraries: 
Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium were instrumental in data processing, visualization, and geographical analysis.
## Data Visualization: 
A diverse range of visualization techniques including line graphs, bar graphs, box plots, and heatmaps were utilized to present findings effectively.

# Conclusion
Project Uber stands as a testament to my proficiency in Python programming and data analysis techniques. By adhering to a structured data analytics lifecycle and leveraging a diverse toolkit, meaningful insights were derived from raw data, paving the way for informed decision-making and future analytical endeavors.
